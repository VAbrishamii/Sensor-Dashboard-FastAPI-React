# Sensor-Dashboard-FastAPI-React
Simple fullstack sensor-dashboard with FastAPI + React + TypeScript (Vite)

ðŸ“Œ Overview

The Sensor Dashboard is a full-stack project that displays real-time sensor data through an interactive web interface. It consists of:

A backend API built with FastAPI (Python) that generates and serves mock sensor data (temperature, humidity, pressure).

A frontend client built with React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS that fetches data from the API and visualizes it (cards, tables, charts).

This project is designed to demonstrate:

API design with FastAPI

Data modeling with Pydantic

Frontend-backend integration

Deployment of frontend (Vercel) and backend (Render or another Python hosting)
